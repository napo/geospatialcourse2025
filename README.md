## Overview

This repository hosts all materials for the *Geospatial Analysis* course within the Master in Data Science program at the University of Trento.

The course introduces fundamental tools and open-source technologies for managing, analyzing, and visualizing spatial data.  
It combines theoretical concepts of spatial analysis with hands-on practice in Python.

The laboratory aims to provide the necessary basis for learning how to manage, analyze and visualize geospatial data through open source tools (geospatial libraries for python, qgis, R …)
At the end of the course, students will be able to:
- understand the specificity of the geospatial data model
- elaborate and integration of geospatial data (vector and raster)
- spatial statistics analysis
- create maps (also accessible via the web)
